    <h3 class="text-center">What is Dashy?</h3>
    <p>
        Dashy is a web app, and script which aid in the ingestion of Viofo Dashcam footage. When you pull into the driveway, enable WiFi, and your locked videos will automatically be uploaded to a storage path of your choice (even NFS). 
    </p>
    <p>
        Dashy also proxies connections to your dashcam, allowing you to view all clips on the camera, and choose to download those files as well!
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a work in progress, but I will be using it for my personal Dashcam, please keep this in mind,,,
